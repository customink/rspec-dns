rspec-dns
=========
RSpec DNS is an rspec plugin for easy DNS testing. It uses the built-in Ruby 1.9 library Resolv and is customizable.

Installation
------------
If you're using bundler, add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-dns'
```

Don't forget to run the `bundle` command to install.

Or install it manually with:

    $ gem install rspec-dns

Usage
-----
RSpec DNS is best described by example. First, require `rspec-dns` in your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'rspec'
require 'rspec-dns'
```

Then, create a spec like this:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe 'www.example.com' do
  it { should have_dns.with_type('TXT').and_ttl(300).and_data('a=b') }
end
```

Or group all your DNS tests into a single file or context:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe 'DNS tests' do
  'www.example.com'.should have_dns.with_type('TXT').and_ttl(300).and_data('a=b')
  'www.example.com'.should have_dns.with_type('A').and_ttl(300).and_value('1.2.3.4')
end
```

### Chain Methods
All of the method chains are actually [Resolv](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/resolv/rdoc/index.html) attributes on the record. You can prefix them with `and_`, `with_`, `and_with` or whatever your heart desires. The predicate is what is checked. The rest is syntactic sugar.

Depending on the type of record, the following attributes may be available:

- address
- bitmap
- cpu
- data
- emailbx
- exchange
- expire
- minimum
- mname
- name
- os
- port
- preference
- priority
- protocol
- refresh
- retry
- rmailbx
- rname
- serial
- target
- ttl
- type
- weight

If you try checking an attribute on a record that is non-existent (like checking the `rmailbx` on an `A` record), you'll get an error like this:

```text
Failure/Error: it { should have_dns.with_type('TXT').and_ftl(300).and_data('a=b') }
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `rmailbx' for #<Resolv::DNS::Resource::IN::A:0x007fb56302ed90>
```

For this reason, you should always check the `type` attribute first in your chain.

Configuring
-----------
All configurations must be in your project root at `config/dns.yml`. This YAML file directly corresponds to the Resolv DNS initializer.

For example, to directly query your DNS servers (necessary for correct TTL tests), create a `config/dns.yml` file like this:

```yaml
nameserver:
  - 1.2.3.5
  - 6.7.8.9
```

If this file is missing Resolv will use the settings in /etc/resolv.conf.

If you need to incrase the timeout above the [default](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/resolv.rb#L344) you can do so like this:

```yaml
nameserver:
  - 1.2.3.5
  - 6.7.8.9
timeouts: 3
```

The full list of configuration options can be found on the [Resolv docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/resolv/rdoc/index.html).
